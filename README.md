Project 1.2.1 Interview App

Topic of the Interview: Food

Questions:
1. What's your favorite food?
2. Why do you like that food?
3. Does pineapple belong on pizza?
4. Why do you think that?
5. What could be better about this interview app?

It's important to collect data about various topics to understand what a community might think as a whole. In this project, the topic is food, so it's not very serious, but collecting data from surveys can be used to understand what citizens of a country think and how the government can help the people live a better life.
